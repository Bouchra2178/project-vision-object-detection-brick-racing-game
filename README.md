# Vision Project
This ambitious project delves into the fascinating world of computer vision by creating two captivating filters - an "Invisible Cloak" and a "Green Screen." These filters are developed entirely from scratch, showcasing the mastery of advanced visual processing techniques. Beyond the creation of these filters, the project extends its scope by integrating a thrilling "Brick Racing" game, adding a playful dimension to the exploration of advanced visual capabilities.
